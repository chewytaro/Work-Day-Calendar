# Work-Day-Calendar

Description 
This project was to continue to build on an already existing code. The goal of this website is for users to add their daily work schedule and save it to the time block that they want. This website will automatically update the clock to show users which hour of their schedule that they are currently on with differentiating color codes: grey for past, red for present, and green for future. 

Here is the link to the page: https://chewytaro.github.io/Work-Day-Calendar/

Here is what the page should look like:
